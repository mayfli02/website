    <p class="paragraph2">

    I have many interests, my favourite as a child was to lie on the grass in the park and cloud bust with my mind. I have always been drawn to science fiction and fantasy because it was total escapism for me, where anything was possible, that and photography are my main interests.

    Photography, is my life! Clichéd I know, but it's true nonetheless. I love everything about it, the history, the mechanics, the techniques and the results. Ever-since being told by my parents I was too young to hold the camera (a Kodak 110) that was it! I saved up my pocket money every week until I could afford my first toy camera at £5.99 at the local chemist. All it had was a manual wind-on and a lever for the shutter. Suffice it to say it was a disaster, the film got mangled and when I took it to the chemist for help, he confiscated it so I didn’t waste anymore of my parents money.

    Fast-forward a couple of years secondary school and I joined the camera club in my lunch hour. When I saw that first image magically take shape in the developer, it started my very long journey of knowledge that I am still on today, Apart from an O Level in photography, I am mainly self taught, absorbing as much as I could from books and magazines and people.
    <br>
    Each chapter that appears here will be a different part of my journey.

    Enjoy…
